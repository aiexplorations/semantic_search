This angry, destructive ghost breaks mirrors, leaves its fingerprints in cake icing, and generally makes life difficult for Sethe and her family; nevertheless, the woman finds the haunting oddly comforting for the spirit is that of her own dead baby, never named, thought of only as Beloved. A dead child, a runaway slave, a terrible secret--these are the central concerns of Toni Morrison's Pulitzer Prize-winning Beloved. Morrison, a Nobel laureate, has written many fine novels, including Song of Solomon, The Bluest Eye, and Paradise--but Beloved is arguably her best. To modern readers, antebellum slavery is a subject so familiar that it is almost impossible to render its horrors in a way that seems neither clich\u00e9d nor melodramatic. Rapes, beatings, murders, and mutilations are recounted here, but they belong to characters so precisely drawn that the tragedy remains individual, terrifying to us because it is terrifying to the sufferer. And Morrison is master of the telling detail: in the bit, for example, a punishing piece of headgear used to discipline recalcitrant slaves, she manages to encapsulate all of slavery's many cruelties into one apt symbol--a device that deprives its wearer of speech. \"Days after it was taken out, goose fat was rubbed on the corners of the mouth but nothing to soothe the tongue or take the wildness out of the eye.\" Most importantly, the language here, while often lyrical, is never overheated. Even as she recalls the cruelties visited upon her while a slave, Sethe is evocative without being overemotional: \"Add my husband to it, watching, above me in the loft--hiding close by--the one place he thought no one would look for him, looking down on what I couldn't look at at all. And not stopping them--looking and letting it happen.... And if he was that broken then, then he is also and certainly dead now.\" Even the supernatural is treated as an ordinary fact of life: \"Not a house in the country ain't packed to its rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky this ghost is a baby,\" comments Sethe's mother-in-law. Beloved is a dense, complex novel that yields up its secrets one by one. As Morrison takes us deeper into Sethe's history and her memories, the horrifying circumstances of her baby's death start to make terrible sense. And as past meets present in the shape of a mysterious young woman about the same age as Sethe's daughter would have been, the narrative builds inexorably to its powerful, painful conclusion. Beloved may well be the defining novel of slavery in America, the one that all others will be measured by. --Alix Wilber"},{"ISBN":"0609804618","Title":"Our Dumb Century: The Onion Presents 100 Years of Headlines from America's Finest News Source","Author":"The Onion","Year":1999,"Publisher":"Three Rivers Press","Blurb":" has quickly become the world's most popular humor publication, misinforming half a million readers a week with one-of-a-kind social satire both in print (on newsstands nationwide) and online from its remote office in Madison, Wisconsin.,Witness the march of history as Editor-in-Chief Scott Dikkers and , award-winning writing staff present the twentieth century like you've never seen it before."},{"ISBN":"1841721522","Title":"New Vegetarian: Bold and Beautiful Recipes for Every Occasion","Author":"Celia Brooks Brown","Year":2001,"Publisher":"Ryland Peters &amp; Small Ltd","Blurb":"Filled with fresh and eclectic recipes by Celia Brooks Brown -- one of the talented team of chefs at Books for Cooks, the world-famous bookshop-restaurant in London's Notting Hill -- New Vegetarian presents an innovative approach to vegetarian cooking.

Die Sonne tief am Himmel, ein winziges Licht, ein erkaltender Stern. Windsto\u00df auf Windsto\u00df der Unordnung. Die B\u00e4ume rastlos, die Temperaturen fallend, die ganze n\u00f6rdliche Religion der Dinge: aufs Ende gerichtet.\",Ebenso st\u00fcrmisch wie sein Anfang wurde Jonathan Franzens Roman in den USA gefeiert. Kritiker \u00fcberschlugen sich mit enthusiastischen Besprechungen; das Buch wurde mit dem National Book Award ausgezeichnet und die Tatsache, dass Franzen sich weigerte, in der Talkshow von Oprah Winfrey aufzutreten, sorgte zus\u00e4tzlich f\u00fcr Gespr\u00e4chsstoff. Seit Don DeLillos , hat es in den USA nicht mehr so eine Aufregung um einen Roman gegeben. Auch hier zu Lande hat der Roman bereits vor seiner \u00dcbersetzung ins Deutsche viel Aufmerksamkeit erweckt. \"Noch nie ist das Buch eines zuvor vollkommen unbekannten amerikanischen Autors in Deutschland so begierig erwartet worden\", urteilte die ,. Franzen erz\u00e4hlt die Geschichte der Familie Lambert aus dem Mittleren Westen. Im Zentrum steht die Frage, ob es Enid Lambert gelingt, ihre drei erwachsenen Kinder f\u00fcr ein \"letztes Weihnachten\" zur\u00fcck nach St. Jude zu locken. Kapitel f\u00fcr Kapitel lernt der Leser das Leben und vor allem die Krisen der Eltern Enid und Alfred und ihrer drei Kinder Chip, Gary und Denise kennen. Alfred, pensionierter Ingenieur, leidet an Parkinson, seine Frau Enid unter ihrem Ordnungs - und Sparwahn, aber vor allem unter ihrem Mann. Der \u00e4lteste Sohn Gary, erfolgreicher Banker in Philadelphia, steckt in einer Ehekrise und leugnet mit aller Macht seine Depressionen. Chip muss wegen einer Aff\u00e4re mit einer Studentin seine Stelle als Literaturdozent aufgeben. Nachdem auch sein Versuch als Drehbuchautor gescheitert ist, findet er sich in Litauen wieder, wo er in einen gro\u00df angelegten Internet-Betrug verwickelt wird. Und Denise, die j\u00fcngste Tochter, verliert ihren Job als erfolgreiche Gourmet-K\u00f6chin, weil sie sich auf eine Aff\u00e4re sowohl mit ihrem Chef als auch mit dessen Frau einl\u00e4sst.,Es ist offensichtlich: Jeder der Lamberts ist auf seine Weise gescheitert. Dabei ist die junge Generation von ihrem Bem\u00fchen gepr\u00e4gt, die Lebensmodelle ihrer Eltern zu \"korrigieren\". Oder wie Gary es formuliert: \"Sein ganzes Leben war so angelegt, dass es das Leben seines Vaters korrigierte\" - was ihm nat\u00fcrlich nicht gelingt. Am Ende steht doch nur die Wiederholung: die Familie als Schicksal.,Der Roman bewegt sich mit enormer Leichtigkeit durch die vielschichtigen Beziehungs- und Gef\u00fchlsgeflechte der Lamberts. Ihre Sorgen, Hoffnungen, \u00c4ngste und Neurosen sind sehr menschlich dargestellt, komisch und tief traurig zugleich. Teilweise gelingen Franzen dramatische Vignetten mit Sitcom-artiger Absurdit\u00e4t. Schnelle Dialoge und Wechsel der Perspektive erzeugen eine szenische Dynamik, die den Leser im Strom der Erz\u00e4hlung mitrei\u00dft. Viele dieser Szenen haben hohen Wiedererkennungswert. Unweigerlich werden sich manchen Lesern Parallelen zur eigenen Familie aufdr\u00e4ngen.,Aber Franzen hat mehr als die Geschichte einer Familie geschrieben. Indem er das pers\u00f6nliche Drama mit globalen Ereignissen verkn\u00fcpft, ist ihm ein gro\u00dfer Gesellschaftsroman gelungen, der seine Leser so schnell nicht mehr losl\u00e4sst.

For the past seven years, he's also had a mistress. Merrion Palmer is intelligent, attractive, and half Guy's age, which also makes her younger than both Simon and Alan. Her dad died when she was a toddler and she's well aware that Guy is something of a father substitute. For years the role of mistress has suited her, but, suddenly, this style of relationship isn't enough for either of them. They've both had enough of sneaking around and avoiding people, so Guy has momentously made up his mind to leave his wife, Laura, and marry Merrion.,Marrying the Mistress dives into the shock waves that buffet the Stockdale family after Guy leaves Laura. The novel addresses the question of how his sons are going to cope, the explosive opinions of his forthright daughter-in-law Carrie and what his teenage grandchildren make of it all. Can any of them avoid taking sides? Should they? And what about the abandoned wife, Laura, a woman apparently so long-sufferingly self-sacrificing she makes Mother Teresa look selfish?"},{"ISBN":"3570300099","Title":"Das Intimleben des Adrian Mole, 13 3\/4 Jahre. cbt.

After much gore and infighting, Pi and Richard Parker remain the boat's sole passengers, drifting for 227 days through shark-infested waters while fighting hunger, the elements, and an overactive imagination. In rich, hallucinatory passages, Pi recounts the harrowing journey as the days blur together, elegantly cataloging the endless passage of time and his struggles to survive: \"It is pointless to say that this or that night was the worst of my life.

These are the confessions, years afterward, of a young man who found at a small Vermont college the life of privilege and intellect he'd long coveted - and rarely has the glorious experience of youth infatuated with knowledge and with itself been so achingly realized. Then, amazed, Richard Papen is drawn into the ultimate inner circle: five students, worldly and self-assured, selected by a charismatic classics professor to participate in the search for truth and beauty. Together they study the mysteries of ancient Greek culture and spend long weekends at an old country house, reading, boating, basking in an Indian summer that stretches late into autumn. Mesmerized by his new comrades, Richard is unaware of the crime which they have committed in his dreamy, unwitting presence. But once taken into their confidence, he and the others slowly and inevitably begin to believe in the necessity of murdering the one classmate and friend who might betray both their secret and their future. Hugely ambitious and compulsively readable, this is a chronicle of deception and complicity, of Dionysian abandon, of innocence corrupted by self-love and moral arrogance; and, finally, it is a story of guilt and responsibility. An astonishing achievement by any standard, The Secret History immediately establishes Donna Tartt as a supremely gifted novelist."},{"ISBN":"1558744150","Title":"Chicken Soup for the Woman's Soul (Chicken Soup for the Soul Series (Paper))","Author":"Jack Canfield","Year":1996,"Publisher":"Health Communications","Blurb":"There are many ways to define a woman: daughter, mother, wife, professional, friend, student...

The reader soon cares deeply about narrator Rachel, the eldest of six children, who yearns for some of the forbidden fruits of the secular world. Her rebbe father is another endearing character; he dreams of establishing a major synagogue and learning center even while he desperately looks for a 10th man for a minyan for his sparse congregation. Most of the story takes place in a suburban community that receives an influx of Hasidim in the summer months; for the rest of the year, the rebbe's family is the neighborhood curiosity. Rachel is a dutiful child who tries hard to please her mother, an angry woman who belittles her husband's dreams and wants to be part of one of Brooklyn's larger Hasidic enclaves. Rachel's glimpses of the larger world come from casual and often uncomfortable encounters with non-Jews and secular Jews in her town, but especially from romance novels, which she reads secretly. Her seemingly flagrant behavior (she refuses to wear seamed, opaque stockings, opting instead for seamless, and will not wear a cover-up over her bathing suit while teaching young girls to swim) brings shame to her family and endangers a marital opportunity for her brilliant younger brother. Despite her resolve to establish a more independent life, Rachel agrees to an arranged marriage, both to make her family happy and as a first step toward a new existence. When this match goes awry, Rachel's solution is both funny and bittersweet. Abraham's intense, sensitive prose and her ability to create vivid scenes and memorable characters augment this authentic, often disturbing, look at Hasidic home life and beliefs.

It is 1972 and Ellen Grier finds herself back in the Midwestern hometown she thought she had escaped for good. Worse yet, she and her family have had to move in with her in-laws: narrow-minded, eccentric people who are as tough as the farm lives they have endured. Devout Catholics, they inhabit a world \"as rigid, as precise as a church, \" and Ellen struggles to live by their motto: \"A place for everything; everything in its place.\" But there is no place for Ellen -- fresh, funny, bright with passion -- in a house filled with the dust of routine and the ritual of prayer, the lingering bitterness of her in-laws' loveless marriage. She tries to be the model woman everyone expects her to be -- teaching at the Catholic school, coaxing her traveling-salesman husband through his increasingly irrational moods, caring for his aging parents -- but Ellen's hopes for her family's future collide with life in this bizarre household, and she worries over her wryly observant adolescent daughter and her timid young son. Encouraged by her friend Barb, a woman ostracized for being \"modern\" and \"wild, \" Ellen begins to consider her own desires and dreams as well. Surrounded by the family's obsession with an exacting, angry God and the disquieting ghosts of the past, Ellen searches for a way to satisfy the demands of this rural community and its traditions until, at last, she discovers the family's darkest secret, one that frees her and changes her life forever."},{"ISBN":"1573228737","Title":"Affinity","Author":"Sarah Waters","Year":2002,"Publisher":"Riverhead Books","Blurb":"An upper-class woman recovering from a suicide attempt, Margaret Prior has begun visiting the women\u2019s ward of Millbank prison, Victorian London\u2019s grimmest jail, as part of her rehabilitative charity work.

For readers of \"Oryx and Crake,\" nothing will ever look the same again. ,The narrator of Atwood's riveting novel calls himself Snowman. When the story opens, he is sleeping in a tree, wearing an old bedsheet, mourning the loss of his beloved Oryx and his best friend Crake, and slowly starving to death. He searches for supplies in a wasteland where insects proliferate and pigoons and wolvogs ravage the pleeblands, where ordinary people once lived, and the Compounds that sheltered the extraordinary. As he tries to piece together what has taken place, the narrative shifts to decades earlier. How did everything fall apart so quickly? Why is he left with nothing but his haunting memories? Alone except for the green-eyed Children of Crake, who think of him as a kind of monster, he explores the answers to these questions in the double journey he takes - into his own past, and back to Crake's high-tech bubble-dome, where the Paradice Project unfolded and the world came to grief. ,With breathtaking command of her shocking material, and with her customary sharp wit and dark humour, Atwood projects us into an outlandish yet wholly believable realm populated by characters who will continue to inhabit our dreams long after the last chapter.

Neely, Jr., provides for the general reader the first compact biography of Abraham Lincoln based on new scholarship. There is no comparable, succinct work on this nation's greatest president. The Last Best Hope of Earth vividly recaptures the central place of politics in Lincoln's life. In Illinois, Lincoln was an established and prosperous lawyer, married to a refined and educated southern belle, and the father of four boys. Throughout his life, however, politics remained his first love. In Neely's depiction of Lincoln, power was never sought for its own sake. Having triumphed over the hardscrabble circumstances of his youth in Kentucky and Indiana, Lincoln, early in his political career, tied his ambition to the search for solutions to the economic underdevelopment of the American West. And in the last eleven years of his life, Lincoln's political ambitions became yoked to a fierce nationalism and a keen moral purpose - the preservation of the Union and the demise of slavery. Lincoln could not remember a time when he did not hate slavery, or revere the federal system. He made his position clear in the decade leading up to his presidential election campaign, and a civil war erupted. Through Neely's eyes we see the growth of this president's advanced ideas about military strategy, despite their price in blood; his husbanding of the resources of the home front, regardless of its cost in national treasure; and his complex defense of the Constitution, notwithstanding a momentary loss of civil liberties. We also see Lincoln's steadfast dedication to the Emancipation Proclamation, while the fate of the republic and the future of four million black Americans hung in the balance.Richly illustrated, nuanced and accessible, written with attention to the age in which Lincoln lived, yet ever alert to universal moral questions, this is a portrait of Lincoln as an extraordinary man in his own time and ours."},{"ISBN":"0312965745","Title":"Secrets of St. John's Wort: A Lynn Sonberg Book","Author":"Larry Katzenstein","Year":1998,"Publisher":"St. Martin's Press","Blurb":"Learn more about \"nature's Prozac\",If you have mild to moderate depression and don't want the unpleasant side-effects or hug price tag of prescription antidepressants, St. John's wort could be just what you're looking for!

The gift of storytelling was a part of her Irish ancestry, so it followed naturally that she would later use her sharp eye, keen intelligence, and inquisitive nature to create stories about the people and things she observed.,Along with all Americans, those who lived in New York City's borough of the Bronx suffered during the Depression. So it followed that when Mary's father died, her mother, deciding to open the family home to boarders, placed a discreet sign next to the front door that read, FURNISHED ROOMS. KITCHEN PRIVILEGES.

(Recently it was rediscovered by a descendant of the Washington family and was reissued under the title \"Mount Vernon Love Story.)\" The experience, however, gave her the background and the preparation for writing \"Where Are the Children?\" which went on to become an international bestseller.

Many prominent writers have acknowledged its influence on their work; students of intellectual history consider it a landmark; and the generation born after World War II considers Buber one of its prophets. Buber's main proposition is that we may address existence in two ways: (1) that of the \"I\" toward an \"It,\" toward an object that is separate in itself, which we either use or experience; (2) that of the \"I\" toward \"Thou,\" in which we move into existence in a relationship without bounds. One of the major themes of the book is that human life finds its meaningfulness in relationships. All of our relationships, Buber contends, bring us ultimately into relationship with God, who is the Eternal Thou.,The need for a new English translation had been felt for many years. The old version was marred by many inaccuracies and misunderstandings, and its recurrent use of the archaic \"thou\" was seriously misleading. Professor Walter Kaufmann, a distinguished writer and philosopher in his own right who was close to Buber, retranslated the work at the request of Buber's family. He added a wealth of informative footnotes to clarify obscurities and bring the reader closer to the original and wrote an extensive prologue that opened up new perspectives on the book and on Buber's thought.

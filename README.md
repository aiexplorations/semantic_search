# Semantic Search

This is a simple semantic search application which implements a vector similarity based approach for searching a corpus of records, mostly books with blurbs, ISBN and other details.

The user can submit a query to the application via a command line, and the app picks up search terms as arguments and finds the nearest books to the text supplied, using the input provided by the user.
